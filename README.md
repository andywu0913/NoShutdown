# No ShutDown

This tool does not have any GUI. It runs in the background which named as `explorer.exe` to bewilder users finding it.

Whenever a user is trying to shutdown the system, a message dialog will pop up and thus prevent the system from shutting down.

## Environment

- Windows7
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
- C# .NET Framework 4.5.2
